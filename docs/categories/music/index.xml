      <description>Spotify This guide is for a very cheap, legitimate, 12 month premium Spotify plan.
By buying a 12 month Spotify premium gift card from India and activating it on an account costs ~$20 USD/year which would be equal to ~$1.6 USD/month.
A new account has to be made but there is an easy way to transfer all music and playlists over.
Buy The Gift Card Visit g2a on their webiste or by their app and search for &amp;ldquo;Spotify 12 month Gift Card&amp;rdquo; Ensure the item you are buying is the gift card and not for an account.</description>
