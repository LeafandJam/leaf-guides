      <description>Stremio is an app that when paired with Real-Debrid, allows you to stream almost any movie or tv show in high quality.
Real Debrid costs money but it is inexpensive and allows for much faster streaming speeds as aposed to streaming torrents. No VPN is needed to use RD as it is all through DDL.
