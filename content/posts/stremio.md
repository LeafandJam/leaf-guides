The ultimate streaming solution. You get EVERYTHING thats ever been torrented, up to 4k, for ~$4 a month.

Real Debrid is what costs money. It is cheaper than any streaming service while also giving you access to everything! It is ideal as you don't need a vpn unlike with torrenting. It torrents movies for you and puts them on their servers which is where you stream from. This allows super fast streaming without torrent activity on your end!

 Real Debrid is what is used to provide media.

1. Go to [Real-Debrid](http://real-debrid.com/?id=7783244) and click ```Sign Up```. Make an account and then buy the service.
