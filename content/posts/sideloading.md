# Sideloading

Sideloading is the iOS equivalent of installing APK's on Android. It allows for "sideloading" apps that are not available on the app store.  

There are way to do this for free involving using a VPN to block Apple's servers but the easiest and most reliable method is to buy a certificate.

## Buying a Cert

>These cert's last for a year and then another must be bought
### Shops
Below are two shops that have so far been legitimate:
- [Kravasign](https://kravasign.com/purchase) (recommended)
- [DX Sign](https://dxsign.cc/purchase) (cheaper)

>Both are recommended however, go with Kravasign if you can, as they include revoke protection in their cheapest tier. 
>>Revoke protection means that if your certificate stops working, they'll replace it — though this is extremely rare.

After purchasing the cert you'll need to join their discord server to download your files. It can take up to 3 days for your cert to be ready (this is an Apple limitation).

Once you have your cert you'll have 3 files:  

1. ```xxxx.p12```
2. ```xxxx.mobileprovision```
3. ```password```
## Setting up Feather

1. Download the latest ```.ipa``` file of [Feather](https://github.com/khcrysalis/Feather/releases/)
>This app will be used to sign other apps once installed.

2. Go to [sign.ipasign.cc](https://sign.ipasign.cc/)
>As we don't have Feather installed yet we have to use a website just once to sign and install it. In the future Feather will do this job for other apps.
>> If Feather doesn't work for you after following these steps, this website can sign apps for you instead of having Feather as a dedicated signing app.

5. Click install when prompted. This will start installing Feather

6. Once installed, open Feather
7. Go to settings and click _Add Certificate_
