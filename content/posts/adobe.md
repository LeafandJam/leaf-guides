Installing all Adobe applications for free!



# ⊞ Windows
## Monkrus method.
For this guide you will need:

- [qbittorrent](https://qbittorrent.org)

It's also recomended to have an adblock such as
- [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/)

A video guide is available [here](https://youtu.be/CC5E3uyedao). (I did not create this video guide)


Go to this link for the [Adobe Master Collection](https://w14.monkrus.ws/search?q=Adobe+Master+Collection+2022&max-results=20&by-date=true).

This website is in Russian but you don't need to read anything. To translate it simply look at the right and find the country flags. Chose your desired language.

Click the top link to get Adobe Master Collection 2022 v8 (or new if new versions uploaded)

Scroll down to the bottom where there is a list of links as shown below.

Click one link such as the ```PB.WTF``` link and find the blue __"magnet"__ button as shown below:

![torrent](/posts/monkrusDownload.png)

In this case it is the blue one. 

Click it and complete the captcha if asked. If it doesn't suggest opening it qbittorrent automatically then download the .torrent and open it using qbittorrent. 

Once finished torrenting, you will have an .iso file. 

Mount the file by double clicking it and run the file named ```autoplay```.

This will bring up the installation for your Adobe apps! 

Finished.

## Filecr Method
[This website](https://filecr.com/?s=Adobe) has pre actiavted copies of Adobe programs. Simply find the desired app and download the installer.

The password for the zip file that is downlaoded is ```123```. To unzip this package you will need a package manaager such as [7zip](https://7-zip.org)

#  macOS
This method is for the M1 chip Macs. This is the easiest method I have tried.

Go to [Cmacked](https://cmacked.com) and search for the desired Adobe app. 

Simply click download and download the .dmg. 

Double click this and install!
