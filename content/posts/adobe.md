Installing all Adobe applications for free!

For this guide you will need:

- [qbittorrent](https://qbittorrent.org)

It's also recomended to have an adblock such as
- [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/)

# ⊞ Windows
This will be using the Monkrus method.

A video guide is available [here](https://youtu.be/CC5E3uyedao). (I did not create this video guide)


Go to this link for the [Adobe Master Collection](https://w14.monkrus.ws/2022/04/adobe-master-collection-2022-rus-eng-v7.html).

This website is in Russian but you don't need to read anything.

Scroll down to the bottom where there is a list of links as shown below.

Click one link such as the ```PB.WTF``` link and find the torrent button as shown below:

![torrent](/posts/monkrusDownload.png)

In this case it is the green one. 

Click it and complete the captcha if asked. If it doesn't suggest opening it qbittorrent automatically then download the .torrent and open it using qbittorrent. 

Once finished torrenting, you will have an .iso file. 

Mount the file by double clicking it and run the file named ```autoplay```.

This will bring up the installation for your Adobe apps!

#  macOS
This method is for the M1 chip Macs. This is the easiest method I have tried.

Go to [Cmacked](https://cmacked.com) and search for the desired Adobe app. 

Simply click download and download the .dmg. 

Double click this and install!
