Windows 10/11 for free! Permanently activated using Microsoft Activation Scripts. An open source tool!

(This will also remove the annoying "activate windows" watermark if you have that)

# Step 1: 7zip
[7zip](https://7-zip.org) is recomended for this process. It is open source and fast! (please stop using WinRAR)

# Step 2: Download MAS
Download MAS from the [official github](https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts/releases) and extract the downloaded .7z file (right click it and click "extract here" using your package manager such as 7zip.

It will then prompt for a password. This password is ```123```.

In the opened, extracted folder, open the folder named ```All-In-One-Version```.

Run the file ```MAS_1.5_AIO_CRC32_21D20776.cmd``` (or a similar named file if the version is different).

# Step 3: Activate Windows
If you need a Windows pro key for MAS to activate then use this one: ```W269N-WFGWX-YVC9B-4J6C9-T83GX```


To activate windows type ```1``` into the screen to run the activation.

Done!
