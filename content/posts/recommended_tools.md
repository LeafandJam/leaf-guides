This guide will _only list basic tools_ which are _commonly needed_ for sailing the seas.

There are [much bigger lists](https://FMHY.net) out there for useful tools however this guide will not list every single useful tool in order to keep it simple and easy to read. This keeps it from being overwhelming and confusing for new users.


# Torrents - [qbittorrent](https://qbittorrent.org)
For torrenting [qbittorrent](https://qbittorrent.org) is the most commonly recommended. It is open source and light weight.

[Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) and [Deluge](https://deluge-torrent.org/) are other open source torrent clients that are recommended. 

# VPN - [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net)
The best privacy respecting VPN is [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net), however it does not support port forwarding.

# Ad-block - [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/)[uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) 
is the best ad-blocker out there. It also acts as a filter which is regularly updated.

[Fast Forward](https://fastforward.team/) is a continuation of Universal Bypass, which skips link shorteners.


# Anti-Virus [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload)
If you have a file which you want to open but suspect it for containing something malicous then you can upload it to [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) which will scan it for you.
