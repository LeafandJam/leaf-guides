This guide will _only list basic tools_ which are _commonly needed_ for sailing the seas.

There are [much bigger lists](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/index) out there for useful tools however this guide will not list every single useful tool in order to keep it simple and easy to read. This keeps it from being overwhelming and confusing for new users.

These are just to get new comers started.

# Torrents - [qbittorrent](https://qbittorrent.org)
For torrenting [qbittorrent](https://qbittorrent.org) is the most commonly recommended. It is open source and light weight.

[Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) and [Deluge](https://deluge-torrent.org/) are other open source torrent clients that are recommended. 
# VPN - [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net)
The best privacy respecting VPN which supports port forwarding for torrenting is [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net).
# Ad-block - [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) & [Fast Forward](https://fastforward.team/)
[uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) is the best ad-blocker out there. It also acts as a filter which is regularly updated.

[Fast Forward](https://fastforward.team/) is a continuation of Universal Bypass, which skips link shorteners.
# Torrent Sites - [1337x](https://1337x.to)
[1337x](https://1337x.to) is a popular place for movies/tv and games as well as software. For a list of safe uploaders for games, check [this list](https://leafguides.xyz/posts/games).
# Anti-Virus - Windows Defender + Common Sense
The best anti-virus for Windows, is Windows Defender and common sense. Many anti-virus software just slows down your computer while not being necessary. With uBlock Origin acting as a filter and adblock, and some common sense, you won't find any problems.

If you have a file which you want to open but suspect it for containing something malicous then you can upload it to [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) which will scan it for you.
