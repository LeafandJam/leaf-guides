How to install games on Windows for free!

# Sites
There are a few different sites to get the game files. The ones I mention are all accepted to be safe and trustworthy.

1. Steam Unlocked
    - [Steam Unlocked](https://steamunlocked.net) pre-installs the games for you so all you have to do is download the files and run the .exe
2. fitgirl-repacks
    - [Fitgirl-repacks](https://fitgirl-repacks.site/) are a great option as they let you chose what to download. For example you might not need the Chinese language files installed). Because of this the game files are often a lot smaller and fast to download.
    - Fitgirl offers many ways to download but the most common and reliable is through torrents. [qBit](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) is the best torrent manager (stop using uTorrent it has spyware, adware)
3. Free GOG PC Games
    - [Free GOG Games](https://freegogpcgames.com/) requires torrenting to get the files.
    - GOG games have no DRM which means what you download here is exactly what you would get if you bought the real thing!
