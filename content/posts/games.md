How to install games on Windows for free!

# Sites
There are a few different sites to get the game files. The ones I mention are all accepted to be safe and trustworthy. (Please let me know if anything changes!)

## Direct Download


1.  GOG-Games
    - [GOG-Games](https://gog-games.com/) come with a ```.exe``` to easily install the game.
    - GOG games have no DRM which means what you download here is exactly what you would get if you bought the real thing!

2. CS Rin 
    - [CS Rin](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/)


## Torrent
1. fitgirl-repacks
    - [Fitgirl-repacks](https://fitgirl-repacks.site/) are a great option as they let you chose what to download. For example you might not need the Chinese language files installed). Because of this the game files are often a lot smaller and fast to download.
    - Fitgirl offers many ways to download but the most common and reliable is through torrents. [qBit](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) is the best torrent manager (stop using uTorrent it has spyware, adware)

2. 1337x
    - [1337x](https://1337x.to) hosts many torrents for many things, games included. Here is a list of reputable game uploaders on 1337x created by [RekulousToad](https://www.reddit.com/user/RekulousToad/).
