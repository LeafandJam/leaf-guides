How to install games on Windows for free!

# Sites
There are a few different sites to get the game files. The ones I mention are all accepted to be safe and trustworthy. (Please let me know if anything changes!)

## Direct Download

1. Steamrip
    - [steamrip](https://steamrip.com) has pre-installed games. Follow the steps below to donwload a game form Steamrip:

    1. Search for your game in the top right corner of steamrip. Click to go to your game's page.
    2. Click the purple DOWNLOAD HERE button.
    3. Download the ```.rar``` file.
    4. Download [7zip](https://7-zip.org) if you don't have it already. (Any file manager like winRAR will work).
    5. Right click the ```.rar``` file and click ```7zip``` > ```Extract to...```
    6. Open the newly created folder
    7. Locate and enter the folder titled your game's name.
    8. Find the ```.exe``` file and run it to start the game.
    9. Done. If any issues occur, read the ```README.txt``` in the root of the folder.

2. CS Rin

## Torrent
1. fitgirl-repacks
    - [Fitgirl-repacks](https://fitgirl-repacks.site/) are a great option as they let you chose what to download. For example you might not need the Chinese language files installed). Because of this the game files are often a lot smaller and fast to download.
    - Fitgirl offers many ways to download but the most common and reliable is through torrents. [qBit](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) is the best torrent manager (stop using uTorrent it has spyware, adware)
2.  GOG-Games
    - [GOG-Games](https://gog-games.com/) requires torrenting to get the files.
    - GOG games have no DRM which means what you download here is exactly what you would get if you bought the real thing!

3. 1337x
    - [1337x](https://1337x.to) hosts many torrents for many things, games included. Here is a list of reputable game uploaders on 1337x created by [RekulousToad](https://www.reddit.com/user/RekulousToad/).
