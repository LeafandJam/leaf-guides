uYou+ is the iOS version of the popular Youtube Vanced for android (no longer maintained.) It offers all perks of YouTube Premium, for free. It also includes features such as SponsorBlock which skips video sponsors for you.

This installation guide is a re-formatted and simplified version of [the official guide here](https://github.com/qnblackcat/uYouPlus/wiki/Installation)

This guide will use sideloading through the AltStore method.

# Install AltStore

# Install uYou+
1. Configure AltStore:
    -  AltStore is installed on your phone, but you can't open it right now. To fix that, go to ```Settings > General > Profile & Device Management```. There will be a profile with your account name in here. After you trust the profile, AltStore can be opened.

    - In AltStore, go to ```Settings > Sign in with Apple ID```. Enter the Apple ID that was used to install AltStore. If AltStore says ‚ÄúCould not find AltServer‚Äù, then check if your phone is connected to Mac/PC.


Congrats üéâ You've just successfully configured AltStore.

2. Install uYouPlus:
    - Get the latest version of uYouPlus from the [release page](https://github.com/qnblackcat/uYouPlus/releases/latest). Select AltStore from the Share sheet.

    - Remove App Extensions is not recommened since it will remove the ability to use Open in YouTube shortcut & Open in YouTube Extension (https://github.com/CokePokes/YoutubeExtensions). uYouPlus will take 3 app IDs in total.

    - The process might take a few minutes. After that, you will uYouPlus on your Home Screen üéâ

# Refresh uYou+
Unfortunately, apps that have been installed using non-developer Apple IDs are only valid for 7 days, and uYouPlus is not an exception. At which point it will no longer open (you'll see an error that says "YouTube is no longer available").

To compensate for this, AltStore will periodically attempt to refresh uYouPlus in the background. In order for AltStore to do that, you must connect your phone with your Mac/PC via cable or Wi-Fi. Then click Refresh All in ```AltStore > My Apps```

To enable Refresh Apps over Wi-Fi. Make sure your phone and your Mac/PC are on the same network.
    macOS: Open Finder and enable ```‚ÄúShow this iPhone when on WiFi‚Äù``` for your phone.
    Windows: Open iTunes and enable ```iTunes Wi-Fi sync``` for your phone.
