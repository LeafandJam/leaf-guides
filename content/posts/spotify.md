# Spotify

This guide is for a very cheap, __legitimate__, 12 month premium Spotify plan. 

By buying a 12 month Spotify premium gift card from India and activating it on an account costs ~$20 USD/year which would be equal to ~$1.6 USD/month.


A new account has to be made but there is an [easy way](https://leaf.guide/posts/spotify/#transfer-music-from-old-account) to transfer all music and playlists over.

## Buy The Gift Card
1. Visit [g2a](https://www.g2a.com/) on their webiste or by their app and search for "_Spotify 12 month Gift Card"_
>Ensure the item you are buying is the gift card and not for an account.
2. Buy the giftcard. A code will be sent to the email that was used
3. Proceed to [Make An Account](https://leaf.guide/posts/spotify/#make-an-account)

## Make An Account
> If you have a VPN already you can skip Step 1. If you're looking to start using one, [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net) is recommended.
1. Download [CyberGhost VPN](https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/vpn-free-trial)
for free by using their free trial (no credit card needed).
2. Set VPN to India
3. Open a private window and search for Spotify and create an account
> Remember your login details as this will be your new account
4. [Redeem your gift card](https://www.spotify.com/redeem/)
>If Spotify asks for a place in India, put any place. If one doesn't work try another.
5. This will successfully activate Spotify Premium on your the account

## Transfer Music From Old Account
1. Visit [Aknakn](https://trikatuka.aknakn.eu/#/)
2. Login with the old and new account and select what you want to transfer
3. Transfer

### Complete
- You can switch the country of the account back to whatever you like once you've redeemed the gift card.
- The vpn only has to be used to make the account and redeem the gift card. After that it doesn't have to be used again.
