# E-books guide

This guide will teach you how to get most e-books for free and how to read them on your mobile device.

## Preparation

- Using an adblock browser or extension is recommended.

## Downloading

Here are the best ways to find the ebook you're looking for. Unless you have a favorite method, always begin with the first one. If it fails move on to the next.

Tip: I recommend that you look for "epubs" files since sometimes PDF rips will be only images.

### via websites

The best websites are:
http://libgen.rs/fiction/
https://z-lib.org/

There are [many other sources here as well.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/oreyow/heres_the_definitive_list_of_sites_for_ebooks_and/)

### via google search

If you were unable to it on the websites above, you can try the following.

This is particular helpful if you're looking for a book in a language that is not english.

1. Go to google.com
2. Type in exactly this (with quotes):

`intitle:"my ebook name" epub download`

So, say you are looking for the book "the secret" by Rhonda Byrne, the search query would be this:

`intitle:"the secret" epub download`

If you are getting way too many results, you can also add the author's first name between quotes at the ending to better filter the results.

`intitle:"the secret" epub download "rhonda"`

### via IRC

### via private tracker

[This](http://www.myanonamouse.net) is the best private tracker for ebooks. It's a bit complicated to gain access, but it's still possible: they do interviews and welcome new users regularly.

### last resort: via request

If you are still unable to find your ebook, it's worth kindly asking at the [torrent request](https://www.reddit.com/r/torrentrequest/) sub reddit.

Some users in there are memebers of private trackers and they can help you out.

## Reading

The best app to read books is Play Books, it's free and it's compatible with both iOS and Android.

[Here is an official guide on how to upload these files to the Play Books app.](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/11012086?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid)
